# Archive: How This Repo Was Built

This folder contains the actual worklog and outline used to write the Vibe Engineering article series.

## Why Include This?

1. **Proof of method.** This repo wasn't just described—it was vibe-engineered.
2. **The feedback loop in action.** The worklog shows 9 milestones addressing reader feedback, each improving the series.
3. **Showing the sausage-making increases trust.** You can see exactly how the articles evolved.

## Files

- **ARTICLE_WORKLOG.md** — The revision worklog tracking all edits based on ChatGPT feedback analysis
- **ARTICLE_OUTLINE.md** — The original outline with self-interview, series structure, and publishing plan

## Key Takeaways

From the worklog's "What Surprised the AI" section:

- "Artifacts that survive context loss" is the defensible edge vs typical agentic content
- Part 1 was "identity-shaping but not behavior-shaping" — needed urgency + action
- NEXT_AGENT_PROMPT.md is "the single highest-impact idea for advanced readers"
- Starter kit is highest-leverage deliverable for adoption
